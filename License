Modifications:
Please see each individual source file for a list of copyright holders.

I have taken the codes for ramutex, lamutex and ratoken the distalgo/examples folder.

I have added my own logging messages that are sent to the driver.
I have added a few extra parameters to the setup function that were needed for testing

ramutex algorithm has been modified as mentioned in the README.

Rest of the work is done by Muthukumar Suresh. i.e., driver process and the graph plotting

Graph Plotting help was taken from matplotlib website examples.
