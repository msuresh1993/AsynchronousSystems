This folder is self contained.
to run any of the specs just load the name.tla and MC_name.tla into TLA+, since I have included the .toolbox file 
so it should restore the same state as in my PC (I have tested that this works fine)

Then just run the model under MC_name.tla and you can modify the values as shown in the report to regenerate the tests


The report is attached titled assignment3_tla_muthukumar.pdf.

I think this info should be sufficient for this homework. Cheers!
