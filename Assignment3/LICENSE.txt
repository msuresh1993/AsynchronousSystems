Modifications:
I have taken the code for timeclocks from the lamport slides and the handout given by Prof. Annie Liu

I have taken the code for MERZ specs from the mail chain between prof. Annie Liu and Steven Merz.

Few additions have been made and have been referenced about where they are taken from ( mostly lamport slides)
